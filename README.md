Asteroids was released in 1979 and was a hugely successful title in early arcade history. This project attempts to replicate the core gameplay of Asteroids within Pygame.

The current implementation features an endless gameplay loop with no real escalation in difficulty, however I plan to add at least one more major update with a scorekeeping feature and an escalation in difficulty over time.
